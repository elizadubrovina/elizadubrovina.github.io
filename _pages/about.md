Bonjour! I'm Eliza Dubrovina, an aspiring cinematographer, session photographer and experienced clinical psychologist based out of Paris, France. I hold a range of formal qualifications, including the degrees of Bachelor of General Medicine (Poltava Ukraine State Medical and Dental Academy), Bachelor of Practical Psychology, and Master of Practical Psychology (Interregional Academy of Personnel Management, Kyiv). In addition to my academic pursuits in medicine and psychology, I have spent many years studying and practicing photography and cinematography. I have now been based out of Paris, France for three years - time that I have spent developing my technique and portfolio as a session photographer and cinematographer. Following multiple years of intense French language studies through various programs at the Sorbonne University, I am now looking to pursue a formal education in cinema direction! <br><br>
